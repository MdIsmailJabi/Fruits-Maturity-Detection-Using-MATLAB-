# Maturity Detection of Lemon Fruit Based On Color

This project aims to detect the maturity of lemon fruits based on their color. The classification is divided into three distinct cases:

- **CASE 1**: **Green** - Indicates unripe (un-mature) lemons.
- **CASE 2**: **Green-Yellow** - Indicates mature lemons.
- **CASE 3**: **Yellow** - Indicates overripe (over-mature) lemons.
